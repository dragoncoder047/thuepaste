# thuepaste

Some utilities for working with the Thue programming language.

For a little intro to what Thue actually is, have a look at the [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thue_(programming_language)).

The demo page is inspired by [this jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/ao6egwh9/3/) and [Chris Pressey's Python implementation](https://github.com/catseye/Thue/blob/master/src/thue.py). I don't know who made that jsfiddle. (If you know, please do tell me.)

Head over to <https://dragoncoder047.github.io/thuepaste/> to try it out.

The name is a pun on 'toothpaste'.
